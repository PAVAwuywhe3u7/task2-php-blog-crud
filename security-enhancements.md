# Security Enhancements Implemented

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive security enhancements implemented across the PHP blog internship project, from basic authentication in Task 2 to the enterprise-grade security features in Task 5.

## Security Features by Task

### Task 2: Basic Security Foundation

**Core Security Measures:**
1. **Password Hashing**
   - Implementation of PHP's `password_hash()` function with bcrypt algorithm
   - Secure password storage with automatic salt generation
   - Password verification using `password_verify()`

2. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - Use of PDO with prepared statements
   - Parameterized queries for all database operations
   - Proper input escaping

3. **Session Management**
   - Secure session handling with PHP sessions
   - Session-based user authentication state
   - Basic session security practices

4. **Input Validation**
   - Server-side validation for registration and login forms
   - Username and email format validation
   - Password length requirements

### Task 4: Advanced Security Features

**Enhanced Authentication Security:**
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Three-tier role system (Admin, Editor, User)
   - Granular permission controls for different resources
   - Ownership-based access controls (users can edit their own content)
   - Permission inheritance and override mechanisms

2. **Account Protection**
   - Automatic account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
   - Configurable lockout duration
   - Automatic reset of failed attempts after lockout period
   - Security event logging for failed attempts

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - IP-based rate limiting for login attempts
   - Configurable attempt thresholds and time windows
   - Automatic blocking of excessive attempts

4. **Session Security**
   - Secure session management with database-backed sessions
   - Session activity tracking and timeout enforcement
   - Session regeneration for security
   - Session cleanup for expired sessions

**Input Security:**
1. **Advanced Input Validation**
   - Comprehensive form validation with detailed error messages
   - Password strength requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
   - File upload validation (type, size, MIME type verification)
   - Search query sanitization

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention**
   - Output encoding for all user-generated content
   - HTML entity encoding for display content
   - Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
   - Proper escaping of user input in HTML contexts

3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**
   - Token-based CSRF protection on all forms
   - Automatic token generation and validation
   - Token expiration and regeneration

**Data Protection:**
1. **Database Security**
   - Enhanced PDO configuration with security options
   - SQL mode configuration for stricter data handling
   - Secure error handling (no database details in user-facing errors)
   - Database connection pooling

2. **Audit Logging**
   - Comprehensive security event logging
   - User activity tracking
   - Permission check logging
   - Failed login attempt recording
   - Account modification logging

### Task 5: Enterprise-Grade Security

**Advanced Security Architecture:**
1. **Object-Oriented Security Framework**
   - Dedicated Auth class for authentication operations
   - Database abstraction layer with security features
   - Centralized security configuration

2. **Enhanced Session Management**
   - Database-backed session storage
   - Session activity tracking
   - IP address and user agent validation
   - Automatic session cleanup

3. **Rate Limiting Improvements**
   - Identifier-based rate limiting (IP, user ID)
   - Configurable time windows and attempt limits
   - Automatic clearing of rate limit records

4. **Password Security**
   - Enhanced password policies
   - Password change security (current password verification)
   - Password history tracking (prevent reuse)

**Monitoring & Logging:**
1. **Comprehensive Audit Trail**
   - Detailed security event logging
   - User action tracking
   - System modification logging
   - Performance monitoring integration

2. **Security Event Analysis**
   - Pattern recognition for suspicious activities
   - Automated security alerts
   - Compliance reporting capabilities

## Security Configuration

### Security Constants (Task 4)
```php
// Password requirements
define('PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH', 8);
define('MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS', 5);
define('LOGIN_LOCKOUT_TIME', 900); // 15 minutes

// Session configuration
define('SESSION_LIFETIME', 3600); // 1 hour
define('MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH', 50);
define('MAX_EMAIL_LENGTH', 100);

// File upload limits
define('MAX_FILE_SIZE', 5242880); // 5MB
define('ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES', ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif']);
```

### Security Headers Implementation
```php
// HTTP security headers
header('X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff');
header('X-Frame-Options: DENY');
header('X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block');
header('Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains');
```

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Tests (Task 4)
- Database connection security validation
- Password strength validation testing
- Input sanitization verification
- CSRF token validation
- Rate limiting functionality tests
- Session security checks
- Role-based access control verification
- SQL injection prevention validation

### Manual Security Testing Checklist
- [ ] User registration with invalid data
- [ ] Login with various credential combinations
- [ ] Password strength validation
- [ ] Session timeout and regeneration
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] File upload security
- [ ] Input validation on all forms
- [ ] Security headers verification
- [ ] Audit log completeness
